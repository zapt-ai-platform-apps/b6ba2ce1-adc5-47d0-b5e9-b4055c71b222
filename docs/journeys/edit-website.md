# Edit Website Journey

This journey explains how the owner uses the natural language editor to generate a website.

1. After successful login as the owner, you will see the website editor interface.
2. The editor displays a textarea where you can type natural language instructions for website creation.
3. Enter your instructions and click the "Generate Website" button.
4. The application shows a loading state while it communicates with the GPT API.
5. Once the GPT API returns the generated content, a preview of the website is displayed below the editor.
6. If any errors occur during the process, an error message will be shown, and the error is logged via Sentry.
7. You can refine your instructions and regenerate the website preview as needed.
