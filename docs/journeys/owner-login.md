# Owner Login Journey

This journey explains how the owner logs into the application to access the website editor.

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. You will see a login screen with the title "Sign in with ZAPT" and a link to the ZAPT marketing site.
3. Use one of the available social login options (Google, Facebook, or Apple) to authenticate.
4. Once authenticated, the application automatically records the login event.
5. If the authenticated user's email matches the owner's email specified in the environment variables, you will be granted access to the editor. Otherwise, you will see an "Unauthorized Access" message.
